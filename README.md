Alternative Rostock design for a bigger and updated Rostock Mini Pro 2: https://github.com/orgua/Rostock_Mini_Pro_2

After buying most of the needed parts for that design I found I could build a bigger delta with the 200mm carbon rods, as the original BOM specified >= 150mm ones. So I decided to cut my vertical aluminium rods at 700mm and build the base from scratch based on a 60º degree rod angle when the effector is homed.

Final goodies  
  
I already had the motors and some mdf wood laying here so that's why they aren't here but you can buy them. I have some 2.5A motors.
